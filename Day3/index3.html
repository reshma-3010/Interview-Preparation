       <!---- 1.Difference between flex row and column?
          Grid is made for two-dimensional layout while flexbox is for one.
          This means flex box can work on either row or columns at a time,but grid can work on both.
          Flexbox,gives you more flexibility while working on either element(row or column).
        2.Explain inline,internal and external stylesheet?
           There are 3 types of styles in CSS.
           i.inline:An inline style is used to apply a unique style for a single element.
            To use inline styles,add the style attribute to the relevant element.
            The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
           ii.internal:An internal stylesheet is used if one single HTML page has a unique style.It is defined inside the
              <style> element,inside the head section.
          iii.External:With an external stylesheet,you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
              Each HTML page must include a reference to the external stylesheet file inside the <link> element,inside the head section and 
              it is saved with a .CSS extension.
              The external .CSS  file does not contain any HTML tags.
        3.Justify-content allows you to do what?
           The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and space around content items along the main-axis
           of a flex container,and the inline axis of a grid container.
        4.Difference between relative and absolute positioning.
           Relative:The element is positioned relative to it's normal position.
           Absolute:the element is positioned absolutely to it's first positioned parent.
        5.What is grid-template-column?Explain the use of it.
           The grid-template-column property specifies the number(and the widths) of columns in a grid layout.
           The values are a space separated list,where each value specifies the size of the respective column.
        6.What is Z-index in CSS?
          The Z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
          An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
        7.What is the difference between padding and margin?
          In CSS,a margin is the space around an element's border,while padding is the space between an element's border and 
           the element's content.-->
        <!--8.What is box-sizing?
          In CSS,the box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height. 
        9.What is an animation-delay?
          In CSS,the animation-delay property specifies the amount of time to wait from applying the animation to an element before beginning
          to  perform the animation.
      10.Which property will you use to merge cells vertically in a grid?Explain.
         Grid-column.
         Grid-column:In CSS grid-column shorthand property specifies a grid item's size  and location within a grid-column by contributing a line,
         a span,or nothing to it's grid placement.
      11.Which property will you use to merge cells horizontally in a grid?Explain.  
          Rowspan attribute.
          Rowspan:The Rowspan attribute specifies the number of rows a cell should span.
      12.What is CSS Box-model?
          In CSS,box-model is a container that contains multiple properties including border,margin,padding and the content itself.
      13.Difference between display:none and visibility:hidden?
          Display:none means that the tag in question will not appear on the page at all(although you can still interact with it through
          the dom).There is no space allocated for it between  the other tags.
          Visibility:hidden means that unlike display:none, the tag is not visible,but space is allocated for it on the page.-->
